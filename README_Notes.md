I had a little time on my hands so I made a menu "prliminary screen" for our  
project. Needs a lot of work, but I wanted to make sure we could create the database  
we need for the project.
You will have to do the "git clone..." to download everything.  
When you do the runserver command, the user name is team3, and the password  
is finalproject.

I have built the models, some html files for the restaurant.
But the system still can't store the order in the admin page,
I will try to fix it and redirect the order page to the order confirmation page.
